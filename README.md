## Overview

This project implements a sophisticated **Behavior Tree (BT)** control system for autonomous robot navigation and manipulation tasks. The core of this system is the `bt_students.py` file, which serves as the **central brain** of the robot, orchestrating complex pick-and-place operations through intelligent decision-making and robust error recovery mechanisms.

## What is a Behavior Tree?

A **Behavior Tree** is a mathematical model for plan execution used in AI, robotics, and game development. Unlike traditional finite state machines, behavior trees provide:

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Complex behaviors built from simpler, reusable components
- **Reactive Execution**: Real-time response to environmental changes and failures
- **Modularity**: Each behavior node is self-contained and easily testable
- **Robustness**: Built-in error handling and recovery mechanisms

In this project, the behavior tree enables the robot to make intelligent decisions, handle unexpected situations, and maintain task progress even when facing navigation failures or localization issues.

## üéØ Core Control File: `bt_students.py`

The `bt_students.py` file is the **heart of the entire robotics system**. This 950-line implementation contains the complete control logic that transforms a TIAGo robot into an intelligent autonomous agent capable of:

- **Autonomous Navigation** with kidnapping detection and recovery
- **Object Detection** using ArUco markers and computer vision
- **Manipulation Tasks** including pick and place operations
- **Intelligent Error Recovery** with state persistence and task resumption
- **Centralized State Management** for coordinated system behavior

### File Location

> **Path:** `robotics_project/scripts/behaviour_trees/bt_students.py`

### System Architecture

The behavior tree follows a hierarchical structure designed for robustness and maintainability:

### Node Types and Functions

#### üß† **Composite Nodes**
- **Selector (Fallback)**: Executes children until one succeeds - used for graceful degradation
- **Sequence**: Executes children in order until one fails - used for step-by-step tasks
- **Reactive Sequence**: Enhanced sequence with continuous monitoring

#### üéØ **Action Nodes**
- **Navigation**: Move_base integration with kidnapping detection
- **Detection**: ArUco marker recognition with TF transformation
- **Manipulation**: Service-based pick/place operations
- **Localization**: AMCL-based robot positioning with spin recovery

#### üîç **Condition Nodes**

- **StateChecker**: Advanced state verification with custom messages
- **CheckRobotState**: Multi-condition state validation

## üîë Key Components Analysis

### 1. StateManager Class
**Purpose**: Centralized state coordination across all system components

**Key States**:
```python
{
    "arm_tucked": False,           # Arm safety position
    "head_state": "unknown",       # Head orientation (up/down)
    "detected": False,             # Object detection status
    "picked": False,               # Pick operation completion
    "placed": False,               # Place operation completion
    "localized": False,            # Robot localization status
    "navigated_pick": False,       # Navigation to pick location
    "navigated_place": False,      # Navigation to place location
    "kidnapped": False,            # Localization failure detection
    "navigation_failed": False     # Navigation failure flag
}
```

### 2. Intelligent Error Recovery

#### Kidnapping Recovery System
**Scenario**: Robot loses localization during navigation (covariance > 0.07)
**Response**:
1. Immediately stop robot movement
2. Cancel current navigation goals
3. Initiate re-localization sequence (robot spinning)
4. Resume task from appropriate checkpoint

#### Navigation Failure Recovery
**Scenario**: Move_base fails to reach target destination
**Response**:
1. Reset navigation failure state
2. Re-execute localization
3. Retry navigation with fresh path planning
4. Maintain task progress without full restart

### 3. Advanced Navigation System
- **Real-time Kidnapping Detection**: Monitors AMCL covariance during movement
- **Graceful Failure Handling**: Preserves task state during recovery
- **Multi-goal Support**: Handles both pick and place destinations
- **Safety Integration**: Immediate stop on localization loss

### 4. Robust Detection System
- **ArUco Marker Recognition**: `/robotics_intro/aruco_single/pose`
- **TF Transformation**: Converts sensor frame to robot base frame
- **Failure Recovery**: Resets navigation state on detection failure
- **Pose Publishing**: Provides transformed pose for manipulation

### 5. Modular Manipulation System
- **CubeManipulator Base Class**: Generic pick/place operations
- **Service Integration**: Uses ROS services for manipulation commands
- **State Synchronization**: Updates global state after successful operations
- **Error Handling**: Provides detailed feedback on operation status
